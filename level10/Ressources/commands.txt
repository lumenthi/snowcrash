# We have 2 files, token and a binary level10

level10@SnowCrash:~$ ./level10
./level10 file host
	sends file to host if you have access to it

# We dont have access to token :(

# After a little bit or reverse, we see that level10 is listening
	to port 6969

# First, let's listen to this port with netcat
level10@SnowCrash:~$ nc -lk 6969

# This is a typical case of a race condition
	The goal here is to change the content of the file just after we passed
	the access check
	So we have a script (exploit.sh) that spam the creation a file
	(/tmp/race) + symlink on our target file token

# Then a second script (exploit_run.sh) that runs the program in a loop, we must catch the
	symlink creation a the right moment so it may take time until we win
	the race

======================================================================
EXPLOIT SIDE:
level10@SnowCrash:~$ sh /tmp/exploit.sh
# The script is looping and creating / deleting the symlink between our
	files

EXPLOIT_RUN SIDE:
